S3 OEU SIMULATION Demo
=======================

Windows application developed with Gnat GPL and GTK Ada 2016.

This R&D Project reuses the on-board SW developed for ESA Sentinel 3 to create a
Windows application that can be used as an engineering simulation.
The application is implemented in ADA 2012 with Gnat GPL 2016 (http://libre.adacore.com/).
The user interface is built with the GTK Ada binding (http://libre.adacore.com/tools/gtkada/)
included in that compiler. At the moment, only a demo version is developed.
